1. Drawbacks of using Web components:-

- Main drawback of using web components unsing angular is the bundle size.

-----------------------------------------------------


2. Impact advantages and disadvantages with respect to actual project

The impact will depend on following factors:
- Will need to list out main modules and common modules
- Export all common modules as individual components / component library so that they can be reused in main modules. (Better approach would be to export as individual as the file size will be reduced).
- Code refactoring needs to be done in individual main modules.
- Need to make sure that events are properly captured for data communication to and from the modules

Depending on above factors, the pros and cons will be as below:

Pros:
1. Distributed modules
2. Each bundle size will be less
3. All components can be reused seamlessly.

Cons:
1. Initially it will be time consuming task to make sure that each component is exported properly.
2. Given the project strucutre, we can not automate the exporting of modules using single script and need to export modules individually. (https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/how-to-compile-your-angular-components-library-into-web-components-47ff0ac73bd7)
